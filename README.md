🛡️ Cognishield

Human-in-the-Loop Cybersecurity Defense Against Social Engineering
Cognishield is a human-centered cybersecurity platform designed to measure, explain, and reduce human susceptibility to social engineering attacks such as phishing, impersonation, and fraud.
Instead of competing with traditional email security tools, Cognishield addresses the residual human risk that remains after automated technical defenses, by treating the human user as an active security component.

🎯 Problem Statement

Modern organizations already deploy advanced technical protections:
Email filtering (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
Anti-phishing gateways
SOC monitoring
Yet, social engineering remains the leading cause of security incidents.

Why?
Because attackers exploit human decision-making, not technical vulnerabilities.
Cognishield focuses on this missing layer.

🧠 Core Concept

Cognishield implements a Human-in-the-Loop security model, where:
Users are exposed to controlled, realistic attack scenarios
Decisions are observed and analyzed
Technical and psychological signals are explained in plain language
The system adapts based on user behavior
Susceptibility is measured over time
The goal is not just awareness, but measurable risk reduction.

🔐 What Cognishield Is (and Is Not)
✅ What it is

A human-risk modeling platform
An adaptive security training and evaluation system
A research-grade cybersecurity tool
A complementary layer to existing defenses

❌ What it is not

An email gateway or spam filter
A malware sandbox
A real-time blocking system
A traditional “click-through” phishing quiz

🧩 Key Features
Learner (User)
Accessible UI (large fonts, high contrast)
Scenario-based attack simulations
Decision-making interface (safe vs suspicious)
Immediate, explainable feedback
Progress tracking and improvement metrics
Adaptive difficulty over time
Administrator / Researcher
Scenario creation and labeling

🧠 Attack Taxonomy

Cognishield uses a formal taxonomy to ensure reproducibility and scientific validity.
Attack Types
Credential Harvesting
Brand Impersonation
Authority Impersonation
Invoice / Payment Fraud
Delivery & Logistics Scams
Account Lockout Scams
Manipulation Strategies
Urgency and time pressure
Fear or threat
Authority and legitimacy cues
Reward or curiosity triggers
Difficulty Levels
Low: obvious indicators
Medium: realistic but noticeable
High: subtle and convincing
